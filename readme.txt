== Description ==
 
Hi! Our plugin created for sites optimization purposes.
With Optimization Tools | ItnYou you can:
*   remove duplicates of the category page
Currently, Wordpress creates duplicates of singular pages, the reason for this is the presence of pagination on category pages and if you add the page number for your singular page - you will have the same result as without pagination params. "Optimization Tools | ItnYou" can fix your problem with one click!
Attention! This function uses 404.php template file of current theme for showing 404 pages. If haven't this file, the plugin will print the next text "Sorry, this page does not exists!" on white screen.
*   expand your Yoast SEO JSON LD of Organization
Currently Yoast SEO plugin can show "Organization Micro Data", but Yoast SEO plugin can show only the logo & title of your company.
Optimization Tools | ItnYou expanded the Yoast SEO capability and can help you to add the organization phones and/or organization emails.
*   remove type="text/script" or "text/css" from your site.
Currently, Wordpress adds these attributes in script & style tags, but the W3C HTML5 validator recommend removing these attributes. Our plugin does this for you!
*   replacing of the current menu item (link) for span-tag.
All SEO-companies recommend removing cyclical links for better site ranking. For this purpose you can make new Menu Walker, but "Optimization Tools | ItnYou" can make this for you!
